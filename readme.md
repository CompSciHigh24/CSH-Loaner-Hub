Ideally, a computer with our site will be up in the main office, and students fill out the form to loan the coumpter instead of using a clipboard so that it is easily trackable.

As soon as students fill out the form, Mr P can easily track all these students as they loan chromebooks on his end via the admin side






































<!-- <form id="Addform">
  <label>Name</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" />

  <label>Email</label>

  <label>Advisory</label>

  <label>Room</label>
  <input type="number" name="room" />

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>

<% if(<%= loaner[x].isLoaned %> === false){ %>
